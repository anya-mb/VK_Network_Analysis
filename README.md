The analysis focuses on my friends graph from the top Russian social
network, [vk.com](https://vk.com/). Data has been retrieved using the VK
API and includes attributes such as first name, last name, gender, city,
education, relationship status, attitude to smoking and alcohol,
personal priorities in life, and the political views of my friends.

In total, there are 399 nodes (friends) with 3790 connections. This data
is represented across 14 connected components.

The report comprises:

-   Examining degree distribution
-   Structural analysis, which includes:
    -   Degree, closeness, and betweenness centralities
    -   PageRank
    -   Assortative Mixing
    -   Node Structural Equivalence
    -   Finding the Closest Random Graph
-   Community Detection, which includes:
    -   Clique Search
    -   K-core decomposition
    -   Detection by Modularity

In this repository, you can find the project code with detailed
explanations. The code is primarily written in Python, with a touch of
R. Additionally, a presentation is available. Most visualizations are
crafted using Gephi and Python\'s Matplotlib library.
