# VK_Social_Network_Analysis
This is the project "Social Network Analysis" for course "Network Science" of Data Science Master Program at NRU HSE (Moscow, Russia). Course page: https://www.hse.ru/edu/courses/325403535

Analysis is done on my friends graph from top Russian social network vk.com. Data is downloaded with VK API and include first name, last name, gender, city, education, relationship status, attitude to smoking and alcohol, personal priorities in life and what is important in others, political views of my friends. 

399 nodes (friends) with 3790 connections are represented as 14 connected components.

Report consists of examining degree destribution, structural analysis (degree, closeness, betweenness centralities, PageRank, Assortative Mixing, Node Structural Equivalence, finding Closest Random Graph) and Community Detection (Clique Search, K-core decomposition, detection by Modularity). 

In this repository you could find project code with explanations (in Python and a bit in R) and presentation. Most of visualisations are done in Gephi and Python Matplotlib.
